# Tic Tac NACHO!
### Cyanne Jones' Mod 1 Nacho Libre themed Final Solo Project

Help Nacho Libre and his borderline unwilling sidekick, Esqueleto, train for their next big luchador match by sparring in an action packed tic tac toe game! Get a friend and share a mouse to place your token in the game box and try to get 3 in a row to win!

To play this fun game, clone this repository to your computer and open up index.html in your web browser and get ready to be the luchador of your dreams!

This project was my final Mod 1 Solo Project made in 2022 using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS and a few audio clips (samples from the Nacho Libre movie, as well as the song Religious Man (I am, I am) by Mister Loco). The pixel sprites were made using Pixel Studio by me as well. You can find my gitHub [here](https://github.com/Cyanne-Jones)! Note: This project was designed to be accessible and can pass the WAVE test.

This project was so much fun, and an insane challenge to design from the ground up. I got COVID halfway through the project, and I have a feeling my coding fever dreams were the biggest help getting this project to be funny funtional

### Future Ideas for this project:
- Adding more animations for a win and a draw
- Add an instructional popup
- Different audio clip when you click on Esqueleto

## See how it works!
